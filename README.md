# WIR-Arduino
Wireless RF 865MHz module ( WIR-1186, WIR-1386 ) Interfacing with Arduino board
he WIR-1186M module is a low-power wireless communication solution that is ideal for Smart Grid, home automation, smart lighting, industrial sensor data acquisition and remote control applications. This module integrates RF69, an extremely low-power sub-GHz transceiver, an MCU for wireless network control, data handling and hardware interface, a PCB antenna and matching circuitry. It has a small 24mm x 36mm form-factor for easy integration.

This module is pre-loaded with a full-mesh stack called WIR-METERING for gateway to nodes communication. This is ideal for Automatic Meter Reading (AMR), Traffic Light control, Street Light Control, Smart Grid and Home Automatic Applications. It has an inbuilt 128 - bit AES Encryption Engine with a user configurable session key for providing security to important sensor information.
This module operates at 865MHz - 867MHz band and has 5 channel options. It can offer up to 2 kilometers* over the air range and even more if modules configured as repeaters are used.
It should be connected to any 3.3V TTL/CMOS logic serial RXD and TXD lines and can support baud-rate of 9600bps to 115200bps.
